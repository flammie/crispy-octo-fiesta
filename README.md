# crispy-octo-fiesta

I experiment with programming languages? The name was suggested by github.

## Hello world

I have written a hello world in many languages:

* C
* C++
* Python
* Rust

They are most minimal things one can write kind of. I didn't follow any specific
idea to minimise the examples systematically or use the best practices, e.g.
there's `std::endl` in C++ even though I know it is newline plus flush, the
mains return `EXIT_SUCCESS`, python has hashbang and main function and the
name main dunder blurb etc.
